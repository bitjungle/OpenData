The dataset found in the file 'bronir2-all.TXT' is a collection of 880 near infrared (NIR) spectra 
in the range from 1300 nm to 2500 nm. The data was collected 
online in a HDPE plant using a Brimrose Luminar 3030 spectrometer between 1998-07-30 and 1999-01-11. 
There are several response variables in the data set, including 440 density and 383 MFR 2.16 kg/190
reference measurements. 

Due to the way the NIR data was collected, there are many interesting artifacts and quite a bit of 
noise in the data (very noisy between 2400-2500 nm).

For more information and an analysis of this dataset, see my [M.Sc. (eng) thesis](rune-mathisen-msc-eng-thesis.pdf):
